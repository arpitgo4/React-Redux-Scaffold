# React-Redux-Scaffold [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/arpitgo4/React-Redux-Scaffold.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/arpitgo4/React-Redux-Scaffold)
Client side scaffold with React-Redux on the frontend and Express server to serve built files in the production mode. Scaffold supports production and development modes, with **Best Developer Experience** ( DX ) by Hot-Loading for the client side application. There will be no need to restart during development, hence making the experience smooth and decrease the delivery time.

## Quick Start
### Just to check everything is working
```
# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Build the client 
npm run build:production

# Start the project ( it will build the client, before starting the server )
npm start

# Open web browser at http://localhost:8080
# You will see a sample Single Page Application
```

## Development
### Scaffold provides two npm scripts, execute both in seperate terminals
```	
# Start client in development mode with hot code loading,
npm run start:development
```

Hit frontend dev server to load application in the browser, enjoy developing :)

Refer to the [react-hot-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate) for further description.
## Production
### Scaffold provides two production scripts
```
# Build the client for production deployment
npm run build:production

# Build the client for production deployment and start the backend server with 'forever' package
npm start 
```
Backend server will start at http://localhost:8080 or the value provided in PORT environment variable, inside **forever** process and bundled frontend client will be served from the `dist` directory.

## Known Limitations
* Hot Reloading of the Routes ( Browser refresh is needed! ).
